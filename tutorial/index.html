<h2 id="sec-1">The Godzilla Prediction System</h2>

<p>
This application demonstrates how to integrate Spray, Spark, and ScalaJS together in a multi-project build.
The premise is that when provided with a corpus of data, Apache Spark is a good tool to analyze it with.
Akka is a good framework to build applications with, and Spray does a nice job of adding Http support to Akka.
Scala is a nice language to work with, and happens to also work well in the client compiling to JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the powers combined are pretty nice!

<h2 id="sec-2">The build script</h2>

<p>
This demonstration uses SBT and specifically the build.sbt style script.
</p>

<p>
It's import to note that this is a multi-project build; one project is defined for server-side Scala,
and the other project compiles to JavaScript for the client.

<h2 id="sec-3">Akka and Spray</h2>

<p>
The middleware layer, Akka and Spray, stands largely on the shoulders of giants,
namely the elegant and clean <a href="http://github.com/darek/spray-slick-seed">Spray Slick Seed</a> designed by <a href="http://github.com/darek">Darek Zon</a>.

<p>
Configuration is provided in the application.conf file. When the Akka system starts, Spark is booted
as well.

<p>
Data is provided in the src/main/resources/input<sub>data</sub>.json file.
