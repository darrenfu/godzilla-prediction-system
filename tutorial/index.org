** The Godzilla Prediction System

This application demonstrates how to integrate Spray and Spark together.
The premise is that when provided with a corpus of data, Apache Spark is a good tool to analyze it with.
Akka is a good framework to build applications with, and Spray does a nice job of adding Http support to Akka.

Therefore, the powers combined are pretty nice!

** The build script

This demonstration uses SBT and specifically the build.sbt style script.

** Akka and Spray

The middleware layer

** Spark

Configuration is provided in the application.conf file. When the Akka system starts, Spark is booted
as well.

Data is provided in the src/main/resources/input_data.json file.
